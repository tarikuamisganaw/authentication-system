Authentication System
This application is a comprehensive JWT authentication system designed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It facilitates a seamless login experience between the API and the front-end application, showcasing best practices in modern web development. With features like automatic reauthentication, users can stay logged in without needing to manually re-enter their credentials, enhancing usability.

The system emphasizes security and performance through the implementation of JWTs for access and refresh tokens, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected during transmission. Additionally, it includes robust password management capabilities, such as "forgot password" and password reset functionalities, allowing users to regain access to their accounts easily.

Data validation and sanitization are prioritized both at the client and server levels, minimizing vulnerabilities and ensuring data integrity. The application also employs Redux Toolkit for centralized state management, making it easier to manage user sessions and application state effectively.
